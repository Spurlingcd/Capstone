      Here at Frown Upside Down, we've learned not to take ourselves to
      seriously. It came with some bumps and bruises along the way though. Our
      mission (we have chosen to accept it, obviously) is to help others
      struggling with the daily perils life has waiting for us. Just check out
      our logo. When someone notices we're feeling down, they like to say "Turn
      that frown upside down!" which means smile to them. SO...we turned that
      whole frown face upside down! HA! <br />
