Here at Frown Upside Down, we've learned not to take ourselves to seriously.
It came with some bumps and bruises along the way though.</p>
<p>
  Our mission (we have chosen to accept it, obviously) is to help others struggling with the daily
perils life has waiting for us. Just check out our logo. When someone notices we're feeling down, they like to say
"Turn that frown upside down!" which means smile to them. SO...we turned that whole frown face upside down! HA! <br>
